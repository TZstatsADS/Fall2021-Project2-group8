## COVID and Crimes in the NYC
Term: Fall 2021

+ Team #8
+ **Projec title**: + Team members
	+ Bohao Ma
	+ Egem Yorulmaz
	+ Jiayi Nie
	+ Qian Zhang

+ **Project summary**: While COVID caused an overall increase in crimes due to widespread food, housing and healthcare insecurity, it also brought a significant increase in hate crimes (notably towards Asian-Americans), with New York City reportedly experiencing a 223% increase in hate crimes in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year. EndHate is a tool for businesses and individuals to learn more about the rise of hate crimes in NYC, and for them to ultimately develop a toolset for reporting such events, increasing citizen engagement. This will help protect citizens, businesses and larger communities.
