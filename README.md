# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

## COVID and Crimes in the NYC
Term: Fall 2021

+ Team #8
+ **Projec title**: + Team members
	+ Bohao Ma
	+ Egem Yorulmaz
	+ Jiayi Nie
	+ Qian Zhang

+ **Project summary**: While COVID caused an overall increase in crimes due to widespread food, housing and healthcare insecurity, it also brought a significant increase in hate crimes (notably towards Asian-Americans), with New York City reportedly experiencing a 223% increase in hate crimes in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year. EndHate is a tool for businesses and individuals to learn more about the rise of hate crimes in NYC, and for them to ultimately develop a toolset for reporting such events, increasing citizen engagement. This will help protect citizens, businesses and larger communities.
